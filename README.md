# BeatSaber Clone VR

BeatSaber Clone VR is a shameless clone of the famous and fabolous game Beat Saber, this was done as a dare to prove to a friend how easy it was to make.

## Import songs
Just download any song from BeatSaver or BeastSaber and unzip it to the "OpenSaberVR_data/Playlists" folder. Make sure that each song has its own folder in the Playlists folder. After that run Open Saber VR and the song should be displayed in the menu.


## Gameplay
If you know how to play Beat Saber then you are good to go. If not then it's really simple to play, just cut the notes (beat blocks) at the side where the glow bar is with the saber in the same color. The blue saber is the right hand, the red saber is the left hand. The notes will be only sliced if you hit with the correct saber on the correct side. Otherwise the block will just went through.

## Features
 - fully support for the songs from BeastSaber and BeatSaver

## Hints
 - Only HTC VIVE is tested, but it should also run on a Oculus Rift or Windows Mixed Reality Headset with SteamVR. If you have one of these, let me know if it works.\
